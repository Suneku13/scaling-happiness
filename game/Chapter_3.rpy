        "Once my uncle finished cooking, he called Sora and me down to the kitchen."

        "Yoshi: Alright everyone, this is a celebration for the newest member of our house, Jiro! So eat up, I wanna see clean plates!"

        "If he wanted to see clean plates he must have wanted to see dead bodies as well."

        "Sora nudged me with her elbow and whispered."

        "Sora" "You go first, let me know if it's edible."

        "No way in hell was I going first. Luckily for me Sora was gullible beyond belief."

        "A mischievous grin crossed over my face as I whispered back to Sora."

        "Jiro" "Don't worry. I tried some of it earlier. It's actually not half-bad."

        "Sora's misty gray eyes lit up."

        "Sora" "It isn’t?"

        "Jiro" "Definitely."

        "Sora eagerly caught a piece of chicken with her chopsticks. I watched her as if I were watching a suspenseful action film. She popped the chicken into her mouth."

        "............."

        "Suddenly Sora's face turned a sickly shade of green. She held onto her neck like she was choking before she fainted and fell out of her chair."

        "Jiro" "Sora!"

        "Okay, maybe I went a bit too far. I bolted out of my seat and picked up Sora. I began shaking her violently."

        "Yoshi" "Jiro, I'll take care of Sora. You have to finish you dinner."

        "Jiro" "Like hell I will!"

        "I continued to shake the unconscious Sora to no avail."

        "Jiro" "Sora! Wake up!"

        "Still, Sora was completely knocked out and wasn't responding at all. Uncle Yoshi's cooking was most definitely a lethal weapon."

        "And the scariest thing is his piano playing is even worse."

        "After the cataclysmic event that was dinner, Sora showed me to my room."

        "Sora" "So this is it."

        "I took a quick look around the room. It was fairly small and was empty aside from a bed. But that would surely change once I got my stuff in here."

        "Jiro" "It’s nice. I like it."

        "Sora" "Really? That's good. I was kinda worried at first, to tell you the truth."

        "Jiro" "Yeah, although it could use some spicing up."

        "Sora" "Spicing up?"

        "Sora repeated my words like a parrot."

        "Jiro" "Yeah, like a pool table would be nice. And a fridge wouldn't hurt either."

        "Sora" "Jiro, those things won't fit in here."

        "I smashed my fist into my palm when I got another idea of how to mess around with Sora even further."

        "Jiro" "Oh and an indoor pool! But it needs to be at least five feet."

        "Sora" "That definitely won't fit!"

        "Oh man, screwing around with Sora was more fun than with anyone else. It never got old and she always thought I was serious. I tried to hold it in but I just couldn't contain it anymore."

        "I burst into laughter so hard, I doubled over. Once my laughing subsided, I wiped a tear from eye."

        "Jiro" "Sora, I'm just messing with you."

        "Sora" "Jirooooo Why do you always do that?"

        "Jiro" "Uh, because it's funny."

        "She just sighed and pushed the topic aside."

        "Sora" "So, do you need help unpacking?"

        "Jiro" "No thanks, I'm good."

        "Sora" "Are you sure?"

        "Sora" "seemed like she wanted to help me more for herself than for me."

        "Jiro" "Yeah, I'm sure."

        "Sora" "Are you positive?!"

        "Jiro" "Absolutely positive."
