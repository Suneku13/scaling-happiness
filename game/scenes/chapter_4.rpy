    "Soon night fell and I was all wired out from unpacking my boxes. I plopped myself onto my bed, and rested my arms. Maybe I should've let Sora help after all."

    "It might've been pretty cold but I was way too exhausted to even get under the covers. I yawned before shutting my eyes."

    "CRASH"

    "I shot awake in my bed. My eyes darted around the pitch black room as I carefully got out of bed."
    
    "I raced over to the light switch and quickly flipped it on. I took another quick look around my room."

    jiro "Nothing's here. Good."

    "CRASH"

    "The same sound from before repeated. I hurried downstairs to see where the sound was coming from."

    "Right after I flipped on the living room light, milk was splashed in my face. I licked some of the tasty liquid off of my features."

    "A drowsy Sora was standing before me with a near empty milk carton. Her orange bangs masked her face almost completely."

    sora "Jiro."

    "With the way Sora said my name and how kept her arms straight, she mimicked a zombie."

    jiro "Sora, are you okay?"

    "Just then my uncle appeared behind me with a frying pan in his hand."

    yos "Don't worry. She's just sleep walking, Jiro."

    "Yoshi smacked the frying pan into his palm a couple of times."

    yos "I'll handle this."

    jiro "And how exactly do you plan to handle this?! By hitting her with a frying pan?! She's your daughter you know!"

    "Uncle Yoshi blinked back his tears as he prepared to strike Sora with the frying pan."

    yos "We have no choice. It's the only way!"

    jiro "Okay now you're just being over dramatic."

    sora "Dad, your cooking is terrible."

    "Uncle Yoshi stopped the pan dead in his tracks right before Sora's head. He stared blankly at her for a while."

    yos "You really think my cooking is terrible?"

    "He waited for a response. All he got is an affirming nod."

    yos "Everything I know is a lie!"

    jiro "Still being over dramatic..."

    "He turned to me, a glimmer of hope sparkling in his eyes."

    yos "Jiro, do you feel the same way about my cooking?"

    jiro "Honestly?"

    "My uncle crawled into a corner and began cradling his knees. He muttered something and started sobbing to himself."

    jiro "Okay, now that's just sad."

    sora "And Jiro, your haircut’s hideous."

    jiro "What?"

    "I pulled a strand of my spiky hair down and stared at it. It isn't really that bad is it?"

    jiro "Uncle Yoshi, is my haircut really hideous?"

    yos "Honestly?"

    "Well, I guess that answered that. It was time to find myself a part-time job to get some money for a new haircut."

    "And if that didn't work, maybe I could just leave the country. I shouldn't even care about these things anyway."

    "Sora the zombie slowly walked towards me, knocking over some cups on the counter along the way. Right, I had to wake Sora up somehow."
