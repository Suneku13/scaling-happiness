label chapter_1:
    "My feet splashed into the muddy puddles formed by the heavy April showers. I let the liquid fall down my face as I trekked through the gloomy atmosphere to the bench I saw on the other side of the train station."

    "I've always wondered why rain is the symbol of sadness. Some people actually liked the rain. I don't, but some people do. Yet it almost always seemed like rain equals depression."

    "Looking around as I continued walking, I saw an old man enveloped in his soggy newspaper and an old woman next to him (most likely his wife), zipping up her jacket."

    "Birds fluttered away as soon as I neared them. I looked up at the gray clouds, which didn't do the rain justice at all by keeping the imprisoned sun."

    "Kids hopped in and out of the mud puddles. At least they didn't let the rain get to them."

    "Finally, I made it over to the uncomfortably wet bench. Suddenly I had a vision. An orange-haired girl stood before me. It took me a while to realize that the girl seemed awfully familiar, somehow."

    sora "Hey, Jiro, you should join the Astronomy Club."

    "The vision was but a quick flash. It was strange though, I didn’t remember having such visions before."

    "I waited for hours until my cousin finally came to pick me up. She ran her hand through her orange hair."

    sora "Hi, Jiro. It's been a while."

    "Sora matched the girl in my vision to a point. But this was the first time I’ve seen her in person in the past ten years."

    jiro "Yeah, it sure has been, Sora."

    sora "Glad to know you still remember me."

    jiro "Please, I wish I could forget you."

    sora "Hey, that's mean."

    "Sora complains, bending forward and swinging her purse behind her back."

    jiro "Relax, Sora, it was just a joke."

    sora "Yeah? Well, you didn't sound like you were joking."

    jiro "Well, I was."

    "Sora and I continued walking for hours until we reached her home. I'd say our home, but even though I used to live here a while back, it still didn't feel like home to me. Not in the least."

    "I took off my shoes after walking inside the familiar strangeness that had been my home."

    "I shook the water off my head like a wet dog."

    sora "No, don't do that, Jiro! You'll get the floor all wet."

    jiro "Sorry, Sora, but those raindrops on me head were killing me."

    sora "Well, next time, just use a towel."

    jiro "I don't know where the towels are."

    sora "I would've shown you where, if you waited."

    jiro "Oh, so then you're not gonna show me now? I don't remember you being so cold, Sora."

    sora "I'm not cold! You know what I meant."

    "I chuckled as I walked past Sora and patted her head."

    jiro "Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go get a towel now."

    "Reaching into the closet beside Sora, I pulled out a bath towel. I folded the fabric over my arm."

    "Sora crossed her arms."

    sora "Liar. You did know where they were."

    jiro "Well, duh, I used to live here, remember?"

    "And with that, I quickly made my way into the bathroom."

    sora "Jiro!"

    "I chuckled to myself as my back rested on the bathroom door. I loved getting on that girl's nerves. It was a challenge but the results were always worth it."

    "After filling up the bathtub, I carefully sat in. I let out a relaxed sigh as I fell deeper into the steaming hot, soothing water."

    "Nothing like a nice, hot bath after a rainy day. The heat burned away all the chilliness the rain shower had forced upon me."

    "Lifting my head back, I let my mind wander. I'll be starting school soon, in about two days."

    "Hm, I wonder what the high school here is like. I don't really remember much of my elementary years except that I hated them."

    "Hopefully this time would be different."
