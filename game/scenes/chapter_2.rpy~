label chapter_2:
    "After a nice, hour-long bath, I dried off and was soon greeted by a tall, orange-haired man."

    "Yoshi" "Yo, Jiro! Howâ€™re ya doing?!"

    "He striked a laughable pose while showing off his pearl-white teeth. He really seemed to like thinking he's a 60's rock star or something."

    "But believe me, he's nowhere near musically inclined. Let's just put it this way: If I had to choose between listening to him play the piano or biting off my own fingers, I'd choose the latter."

    "Jiro" "Hi, Uncle Yoshi. It's good to see you again."

    "I tried my best to smile. Now don't get me wrong, I've got no beef with my uncle; I love him to death. But I just can't stand how much he looks like me, from our ocean blue eyes to our fiery orange hair. And I don't even wanna remember how many times someone called him my dad."

    "Or even worse, my brother."

    "Very fearsome memories, indeed."

    "Yoshi" "It's good to see you, too, my wonderful nephew! I planned a special dinner for you!"

    "Jiro" "I thought Sora is the one who cooks."

    "Yoshi" "She usually does, but I wanted to cook! To celebrate my favorite nephew coming to live with me!"

    "He wrapped his arm around my neck, as if he was my best friend. I winced as I tried to pry his arm off of me. He was unbelievably strong, even for a grown man."

    "Jiro" "I'm your only nephew."

    "Yoshi" "And you're still my number one!"

    "My uncle flipped his thumb up and flashed his glittery white teeth again. He did it so often, you'd think he was a dentist."

    "But no, he worked at a candy store."

    "......Hooray for irony!"

    "Eventually, Uncle Yoshi released me from his tight grip."

    "Yoshi" "Well, I should probably go finish up dinner. Trust me, you're gonna love it."

    "I just smiled and nodded. Smiling and nodding, the best tactic for when I can't come up with something subtle or clever to say. Smiling and nodding was always a winner."

    "Maybe I'd get lucky and something would pop up and we could just get take-out or something. Suddenly, an obnoxious beeping alarm went off, coming from the kitchen."

    "Yoshi" "Ah, Fudge McSicles!"

    "Uncle Yoshi sprinted into the kitchen like an Olympian. He hurriedly took the food out of the oven. Wiping sweat off his head with a dish rag, he sighed in relief."

    "Yoshi" "Phew, man, that was close."

    "My Uncle laughed haughtily."

    "Yoshi" "Well, it's all good now."

    "It sure didn't smell good."

    "I gave my uncle a questioning look."

    "Jiro" "So, Fudge McSicles, really?"
