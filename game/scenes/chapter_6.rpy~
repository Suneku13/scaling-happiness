    "Eventually Sora released me from her fierce grasp. You wouldn't think it because of her appearance and personality but she definitely inherited her dad's strength."

    "My ear was now a fiery shade of red thanks to Sora. My cousin turned to me and beamed."

    sora "So, are you ready?"

    jiro "As long as you don't pull on my ear anymore, yeah."

    sora "No promises."

    "Sora started humming as we walked around the town. A short time later, we arrived at a cafe."

    sora "This is Butterfly Cafe. The food’s pretty good and it's close to our house too."

    "Butterfly Cafe? I didn’t think I wanted to be caught dead in a place with a name like that."

    sora "It's also where my school's astronomy club meets."

    "Sora placed her finger on her lips as if an idea was coming to her."

    sora "Hey, Jiro, you should join Astronomy Club."

    "Those words took me by surprise. I remembered hearing them before. I wracked by brain trying to remember as Sora ranted about her astronomy club."

    "Then it hit me. Back when I was waiting at the train station. I had that vision of Sora asking me the same thing. Still, it was strange. I never believed in psychic powers or anything like that. So in the end I tossed it aside as just a coincidence."

    sora "So what do you think?"

    "Sora snapped me out of my thoughts."

    jiro "What do I think about what?"

    sora "About joining Astronomy Club, silly."

    jiro "Pass."

    "I replied immediately after Sora finished her sentence."

    sora "What do you mean pass? You love astronomy."

    jiro "Yeah, when I was a kid. But it just doesn't seem as cool to me as it did back then."

    "Sora seemed a little disappointed when I said that. Come to think of it, when did she start liking astronomy?"

    sora "Well at least think about it, okay?"

    jiro "Sure."

    "Sora and I walked until we came close to a school building. She pointed over to it."

    sora "And that's the town's high school. But you'll have to wait until tomorrow to see the inside."

    "Sora moved her finger to point behind the school."

    sora "It’s hard to see from here, but behind our school is the town’s shrine."

    jiro "Shrine, huh?"

    "I didn’t know if it was just because I couldn’t see it or whatever but my interest was piqued about the shrine."

    "Next to school was a small restaurant the size of an inn. Sora noticed me looking at the restaurant."

    sora "Oh, that's Family Corner. It's a restaurant owned by a couple."

    jiro "By a couple, huh? So, do they have other workers or is it just them?"

    sora "Yeah, it's just those two. The wife cooks and the husband serves the food. But since it's pretty small it's not like they're ever overworked."

    "Sora then took me to a convenience store. It wasn't a very popular one and was about as small as the restaurant."

    sora "And this is the main store everyone goes to for groceries."

    "I looked around and Sora was right. In fact, all it had was basic and essential grocery items."

    sora "Alright, wait here. I have to get some stuff for dinner tonight?"

    jiro "Wait here? Geez Sora, how old do you think I am?"

    sora "Do you really want me to answer that?"

    "There was a brief pause before Sora giggled and headed down one of the aisles."
