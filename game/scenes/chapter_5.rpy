    "The next morning, my peaceful slumber was disrupted by my uncle kicking my door open."

    yos "Jiro, it's time for a delicious breakfast!"

    jiro "Did you make it?"

    yos "I'm afraid not this time."

    "I'm not sure I could take his cooking again."

    jiro "Oh, so then Sora's making it?"

    "Uncle Yoshi flashed a toothy smile at me, followed by a thumbs up. Yeah, that was getting old real fast."

    yos "Correct you are!"

    jiro "I don't need clarification. Sora's the only other person in this house, remember?"

    "My uncle paused, taking a while to process the information."

    yos "Oh, yeah. I guess you're right."

    "Then Sora walked into my room in a hot pink apron. She held a mixing spoon in her hand."

    sora "It's ready."

    "Heh, time for some more fun."

    jiro "What? You're not gonna bring it up to my room for me?"

    sora "Jiro, you know you have go downstairs and get it yourself."

    jiro "What if I payed you zero bucks?"

    sora "That's just nothing at all, Jiro."

    jiro "Fine, I'll go get it myself."

    sora "Oh, but hurry and eat quickly, okay? I wanna give you a tour of the town."

    jiro "It's a rural town, Sora. What's there to tour?"

    sora "Well, there's lots of stuff. But I'm not gonna tell you 'cause I want it to be a surprise."

    "Sora winked at me and giggled. I guess she thought this was a good idea."

    "I sat down on my bed and whipped out my cell phone. I started playing a game on the device."

    jiro "Okay. Let me know when you're finished."

    sora "You have to come, too, silly."

    jiro "Oh, really? You learn something new everyday, huh?"

    "I spoke with a sarcastic edge in my voice. Sora sighed lightly at my remark and leaned against the wall a little."

    sora "Please stop doing that."

    "I gave her a fake perplexed look just for amusement. I shrugged."

    jiro "Stop doing what?"

    sora "You know what."

    jiro "Showering? Sorry, no can do. I like to be squeaky clean."

    sora "Jiro."

    "The tone in Sora's voice both warned and begged me stop. I decided to comply. She had enough for now, anyway."

    jiro "All right, all right. I'm done."

    "Sora nodded approvingly and smiled."

    sora "Good."

    "I raised my eyebrow as I heard sulking in the background. I turned around to find my uncle huddled up in the corner of my room. A depressing air loomed over him as he muttered to himself."

    yos "I feel like a pile of sand. My own daughter hasn't even said \"Good morning\" to me yet. I bet she hasn't even noticed I'm here."

    "There he was again. He got depressed so easily."

    jiro "Hey, don't worry. I'm sure Sora saw you. Right, Sora?"

    "Sora waved her hand and smiled."

    sora "Oh, hey, Dad, I didn't see you there."

    "I slapped my face with my palm. Damn it, Sora. Now you probably just made it worse."

    yos "I knew it."

    "Uncle Yoshi buried his face in his hands."

    yos "I'm ashamed!"

    jiro "You're being over dramatic again..."

    sora "So, I think it's time for us to all go and eat now. Otherwise, the food will get cold."

    "After we went downstairs, Sora placed our food on the table."

    sora "Eat up. I hope you like it, Jiro."

    "I remembered the last time I was over here, Sora was a superb cook. And if it's true that you only get better with practice, then Sora's seven years of cooking practice really paid off. But I wasnâ€™t going to give her that satisfaction without a fight."

    jiro "We'll see."

    "I popped some of the rice into my mouth. Sora watched me anxiously. I know I said I wouldn't do it anymore, but looking at Sora's face, I just had to milk it out a little more."
    
    sora "So, what do you think?"

    "I rubbed my chin precociously to further Sora's anxiety."

    jiro "Eh, it could be better."

    "Sora sighed before pinching my ear."

    sora "Okay, let's tour the place now."

    "Sora pulled me along by the ear. Her nails dug into my earlobe."

    jiro "Ow, Sora, I was just kidding. Your cooking is always awesome. Now please let go."
